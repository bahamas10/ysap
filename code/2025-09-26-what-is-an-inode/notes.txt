notes for dave to follow for the video

1. show meme
 - discuss how it'll be simple at the beginning and then get more complex
 - "i used to be here... but now i'm here and it's a mess lol"
2. love to end the video by saying "inode is the files metadata"... that's 99%
true. but let's do some example and dive into it.
 - different filesystems define what is in the inode and what it looks like on
   the disk (the on-disk representation) - in fact filesystems like ZFS don't
   technically have inodes but have dnodes... but you'll still find inode in the
   source code.
 - people will know what you mean when you say inode, even if you just mean stat
   buffer (don't use that term yet)

3. show basic example on terminal

```
echo foo > file
ls
cat foo
# we have the filename, and the file contents, what else is there?
stat file
gstat file
```

other languages will have this information too!

```
python3
import os
os.listdir(".")
```

```
node
fs.statSync('.')
```

alias nstat='node -pe "JSON.stringify(fs.statSync(process.argv[1]))"'

4. recap

so what's not there? the filename isn't in here? it's in the directory.

# so we have 3 main things:
1. file name
2. file metadata
3. file contents

with the filename we can get the inode, and with the inode we can get the data.
the kernel abstracts this so we don't need to do this manually.

all file types have an inode - including directories.  directories are a special
type of file, just link symlinks, pipes, etc.

5. dir0 (IMAGE_SIZE=50%)

... do all the dirs, creating them as you go ...

6. show `--show-dot` and `--show-dot-dots` on dir0, dir7, dir8

conclusion - show how we make the diagrams fully





- future video on ls? why `ls` is more complicated than you think!

illumos-gate: usr/src/uts/common/sys/fs/ufs_inode.h


python3
import os
os.listdir(".")
// an array of the filenames as strings

nodejs readdir is sorted
pull up js
pull up src
check uv docs

it seems like its in scandir

ls -U1 on illumos
ls -f1 on mac
